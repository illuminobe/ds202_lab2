**1.How are the ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of the ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.**
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, main = "Rating distribution", xlab = "Rating")
```

The ratings mainly fall between 2 to 4, there is outlier at the far right of the graph.

**2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar?**
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct,choco$Rating,main = "Rating VS Cocoa Percentage", xlab = "Cocoa Percentage",ylab="Rating")
```

Based on the graph, higher cocoa percentage normally comes with lower rating whereas the ratings of  cocoa percentage of 70% varies from 1 to 5.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Question Set (Individual)
1. How are the ratings distributed? Draw a histogram of the ratings and describe it. Donâ€™t forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, main = "Rating distribution", xlab = "Ratings")
```

The shape of the ratings distribution is skewed left. The distribution is centered around 3-ish. There seems to be an outlier at the far right of the histogram.

2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar?
```{r}
boxplot(Rating ~ factor(Cocoa.Pct), data = choco, main = "Ratings vs Cocoa Percentage", xlab = "Percent of Cocoa", ylab = "Rating")
```

The answer seems to be yes. From the boxplot, the higher average ratings occur between 63 and 70% chocolate.
